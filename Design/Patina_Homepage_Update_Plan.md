# Patina Homepage — Aesthete Engine Integration Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Page Structure

| Section | Eyebrow | Headline | Content |
|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Hero** | — | "Where Time Adds Value" | "Discover furniture that grows more beautiful with every year. See it in your space. Know the makers." + Heritage makers since 1904 |
| **Why Patina** | WHY PATINA | "Furniture with *meaning*" | 3 cards: See It In Your Space, Know the Makers, Quality That Lasts |
| **The Experience** | THE EXPERIENCE | "See before you *decide*" | 4 steps: Scan room → Browse curated → Place & visualize → Purchase confidently |
| **The Makers** | THE MAKERS | "Meet the *craftspeople*" | Maker carousel (Vermont Woodworks, Nakashima, Sashimono, Studio Piet) |
| **Community** | COMMUNITY | "Loved by *design enthusiasts*" | 3 testimonials + stats (4.8★, 10K+ users, 50+ makers) |
| **Professional Help** | PROFESSIONAL HELP | "Work with a *designer*" | Designer services intro |
| **Final CTA** | GET STARTED | "Ready to find your next *heirloom*?" | Download prompt |

### What's Working Well

1. **Strong brand voice** — "Where Time Adds Value" is memorable and on-brand
2. **Emotional storytelling** — Heritage, craftsmanship, and meaning are well-positioned
3. **Social proof present** — Testimonials, ratings, and maker counts build trust
4. **Clear visual hierarchy** — Sections flow logically from discovery to action
5. **Maker emphasis** — Artisan stories are prominently featured

### Critical Gap: The Aesthete Engine

The homepage makes **zero mention** of Patina's proprietary intelligence system. This is significant because:

- The primary competitive differentiator is completely absent
- "Designer-taught AI" would distinguish Patina from every competitor
- Current copy focuses on *what* Patina offers (AR, makers, quality) but not *how* it personalizes recommendations
- Users don't understand why Patina's recommendations would be better than other furniture apps

---

## Integration Strategy

### Philosophy: Enhance, Don't Replace

The homepage has strong bones. Rather than a complete redesign, we'll strategically inject The Aesthete Engine into existing sections while adding one new dedicated section. The goal is to make the intelligence system feel like a natural evolution of the existing narrative, not a bolted-on feature.

## Section-by-Section Updates

### 1. Hero Section

**Current:**
```
Headline: Where Time Adds Value
Subheadline: Discover furniture that grows more beautiful with 
             every year. See it in your space. Know the makers.
Accent: Heritage makers since 1904
```

**Recommended:**
```
Headline: Where Time Adds Value (keep)

Subheadline: Discover furniture that grows more beautiful with 
             every year. See it in your space. Know the makers.
             
NEW Secondary line: Powered by The Aesthete Engine™—designer-taught 
                    intelligence that learns what you love.

Accent: Heritage makers since 1904 (keep)
```

**Rationale:**
- Preserve the strong brand tagline
- Add The Aesthete Engine as a qualifying differentiator
- "Designer-taught intelligence" is the hook that no competitor can claim
- Secondary line doesn't compete with primary emotional message

**Visual consideration:** 
- The Aesthete Engine™ could be styled in Clay Beige as a subtle badge
- Consider adding a small "Learn more" anchor that scrolls to the new Aesthete section

---

### 2. Why Patina Section

**Current Cards:**
1. **See It In Your Space** — "Use AR to place furniture in your room before you buy. No guessing, no measuring—just clarity."
2. **Know the Makers** — "Every piece comes with its story—the craftspeople, traditions, and materials that make it special."
3. **Quality That Lasts** — "Furniture built to become heirlooms. Materials and craftsmanship that age beautifully."

**Recommended Cards:**

| Card | Current Title | New Title | New Copy |
|------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | See It In Your Space | **Discover Your Style** | "The Aesthete Engine learns what draws your eye—then shows you furniture that fits not just your room, but your life. No questionnaires. Just intuition." |
| 2 | Know the Makers | Know the Makers | "Every piece comes with its story—the craftspeople, traditions, and materials that make it special. *Plus designer insights you won't find anywhere else.*" |
| 3 | Quality That Lasts | Quality That Lasts | "Furniture built to become heirlooms. Materials and craftsmanship that age beautifully. *Curated by designers who know what lasts.*" |

**Alternative approach — Add 4th card:**

Keep existing 3 cards and add:
```
4. Intelligence That Learns
   "Other apps show what's popular. Patina shows what's right. 
    Our designer-taught AI improves with every interaction—
    reaching 90%+ accuracy over time."
```

**Rationale:**
- Card 1 transformation is most impactful—shifts from feature (AR) to benefit (personalization)
- Cards 2-3 get subtle additions linking to designer expertise
- 4th card option provides dedicated real estate without changing existing content

Eyebrow: THE INTELLIGENCE

Headline: Other apps show you what's popular.
          Patina shows you what's *right*.

Body: The Aesthete Engine™ is our proprietary intelligence system 
where professional interior designers actively teach the AI what 
no algorithm could discover on its own. The result? Recommendations 
that feel curated by someone who actually knows you.

COLUMN 1 — Designer-Taught Intelligence
Real interior designers encode their expertise into every 
recommendation:
• "This leather only gets better with age"
• "Marble needs coasters—always"
• "Perfect for pet-free homes"

COLUMN 2 — Invisible Learning
Your actions reveal authentic preferences. Quick taps show 
confidence. Slow swipes reveal thoughtfulness. Time spent 
viewing signals genuine interest. We notice what you don't 
realize you're telling us.

COLUMN 3 — Always Improving
Start at 75% match accuracy. Reach 90%+ over time. The Aesthete 
Engine doesn't just remember your preferences—it understands 
the patterns behind them.

CTA: See how it works in the app →
```

**Visual Options:**
- Animated diagram showing: Designer teaching → Engine learning → User benefiting
- Side-by-side comparison: "Generic app" grid vs. "Patina" focused selection
- Subtle floating UI elements suggesting the learning process

**Rationale:**
- Dedicated section gives The Aesthete Engine proper positioning
- "Other apps show popular / Patina shows right" is immediately differentiating
- Three-pillar structure makes abstract AI tangible
- Concrete examples ("marble needs coasters") demystify the system
- Accuracy metrics (75% → 90%) build credibility

---

### 4. The Experience Section

**Current Steps:**
1. Scan your room with your phone
2. Browse curated, quality pieces
3. Place and visualize in your space
4. Purchase with complete confidence

**Recommended Updates:**

| Step | Current | Updated |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Scan your room with your phone | **Walk your room together** — Point and scan while style questions emerge naturally. No forms. No interrogation. |
| 2 | Browse curated, quality pieces | **See what fits** — Not 10,000 options to sort. 10 pieces that belong—each carrying a designer's insight. |
| 3 | Place and visualize in your space | **Live with it first** — Watch morning light catch the grain. See it at sunset. Know it works before it arrives. |
| 4 | Purchase with complete confidence | **Purchase with clarity** — Every piece vetted by designers. Every fit confirmed by you. |

**Section Headline Update:**

```
Current: "See before you decide"
Updated: "From scan to certainty in under 10 minutes"
```

**Section Intro Update:**

```
Current: "Our AR technology lets you place furniture in your 
         actual space—so you know it fits before it arrives."

Updated: "Walk your room. Discover your style. Find furniture that 
         fits—not just the space, but the life you're building. 
         The Aesthete Engine does the filtering. You do the deciding."
```

**Rationale:**
- Steps become a journey narrative, not feature checklist
- "10 pieces that belong, not 10,000 to sort" is a powerful differentiator
- Time claim ("under 10 minutes") removes friction concern
- AR feature becomes experiential ("morning light") not technical

---

### 5. The Makers Section

**Current:**
```
Eyebrow: THE MAKERS
Headline: Meet the craftspeople
Body: Every piece in our collection comes from makers we trust—
      artisans with generations of expertise.
```

**Recommended:**
```
Eyebrow: THE MAKERS

Headline: Meet the *craftspeople* (keep)

Body: Every piece in our collection comes from makers we trust—
      artisans with generations of expertise. Professional designers 
      evaluate each partnership, so quality is assured before a 
      piece ever reaches your screen.
```

**Add to individual maker cards:**
- Small badge or indicator: "Designer-curated" or "Verified heritage"
- This connects the makers to The Aesthete Engine's quality curation

**Rationale:**
- Makers section is already strong—light touch enhancement
- Adding designer evaluation connects to intelligence narrative
- Doesn't overshadow the artisan stories

---

### 6. Community Section (Testimonials)

**Current testimonials focus on:**
- AR preventing purchase mistakes
- Story behind furniture feeling special
- Design consultation quality

**Recommended additions/replacements:**

**NEW Testimonial Option 1 (Recommendation Accuracy):**
```
"I was skeptical about an app understanding my style. But the 
recommendations were eerily accurate—it showed me pieces I didn't 
know I wanted but immediately loved."

— Alex R., Denver, CO
```

**NEW Testimonial Option 2 (Designer Intelligence):**
```
"The little notes on each piece—'better with 9ft ceilings' or 
'this fabric shows pet hair'—saved me from mistakes I would have 
made anywhere else."

— Rachel K., Minneapolis, MN
```

**Stats section enhancement:**

| Current | Updated |
|---------|---------|
| 4.8★ App Store Rating | 4.8★ App Store Rating |
| 10K+ Happy Users | 10K+ Happy Users |
| 50+ Heritage Makers | **90%+ Match Accuracy** (replaces "50+ Heritage Makers" or add as 4th stat) |

**Rationale:**
- Social proof for The Aesthete Engine specifically
- Designer insights testimonial makes the feature tangible
- Adding accuracy stat reinforces the intelligence positioning

---

### 7. Professional Help Section

**Current:**
```
Headline: Work with a designer
Body: Need more guidance? Our network of professional designers 
      can help bring your vision to life—from single rooms to 
      whole-home transformations.
```

**Recommended:**
```
Headline: When you're ready for more, so is your profile.

Body: Some projects need more than an app. When you're ready, 
      your room scan, style profile, and saved pieces transfer 
      seamlessly to professional designers.

      No starting over. No re-explaining. Your designer receives 
      the depth most consultations take weeks to achieve—before 
      the first conversation.

Bullet points:
• Complete room dimensions and 3D model
• Your full style profile with confidence scores  
• Behavioral signals revealing hidden preferences
• Saved pieces showing your direction

CTA: Learn About Design Services
```

**Rationale:**
- Positions the Aesthete Engine data as a valuable asset
- "Depth most consultations take weeks to achieve" quantifies value
- Creates a bridge between self-service and professional service
- Reinforces that the system is building something useful

---

### 8. Final CTA Section

**Current:**
```
Eyebrow: GET STARTED
Headline: Ready to find your next heirloom?
Body: Download the Patina app to explore furniture in AR, 
      discover makers, and connect with designers.
```

**Recommended:**
```
Eyebrow: GET STARTED

Headline: Ready to discover what *belongs*?

Body: The best interiors aren't decorated—they're cultivated 
      over time, with pieces that grow more beautiful with age. 
      Let The Aesthete Engine show you where to start.

Secondary: Scan your first room in under 10 minutes.

CTA Primary: Download on the App Store
CTA Secondary: Or explore furniture on web
```

**Rationale:**
- "What belongs" echoes the focused recommendation value prop
- "Cultivated over time" connects to Patina philosophy
- The Aesthete Engine gets final mention
- Time claim removes friction

1. Walk your room together
   Point and scan while style questions emerge naturally. 
   No forms. No interrogation.

COMMUNITY

Loved by design enthusiasts

"I was skeptical about an app understanding my style. But the 
recommendations were eerily accurate—it showed me pieces I didn't 
know I wanted but immediately loved."
— Alex R., Denver, CO

"The little notes on each piece—'better with 9ft ceilings' or 
'this fabric shows pet hair'—saved me from mistakes I would have 
made anywhere else."
— Rachel K., Minneapolis, MN
