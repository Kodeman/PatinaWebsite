# Patina /app Page — Comprehensive Update Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Page Structure

**Hero Section:**
- Eyebrow: "PATINA APP"
- Headline: "Furniture shopping, reimagined"
- Subheadline: "See how pieces look in your space with AR. Discover the makers behind the craft. Find furniture that tells a story."
- CTA: "Download for iOS" + "Android coming soon"
- Visual: App screenshot placeholder

**Features Section:**
- Header: "FEATURES" / "Everything you need to discover"
- 4 Feature Cards:
  1. AR Visualization — "See how furniture looks in your actual space before you buy."
  2. Maker Stories — "Explore the craftspeople behind each piece through immersive stories."
  3. Save Favorites — "Create collections of pieces you love and share with designers."
  4. Designer Connect — "Work with expert designers directly through the app."

**CTA Section (dark background):**
- Headline: "Ready to discover furniture with meaning?"
- Subheadline: "Join thousands discovering artisan-crafted furniture through AR."
- CTA: "Download on the App Store"
- Secondary: "Or browse our collection on the web"

**Footer:** Standard navigation

## Critical Gaps Identified

### 1. Missing Core Differentiator: The Aesthete Engine
The page makes zero mention of Patina's proprietary intelligence system. This is the primary competitive moat—professional designers actively teaching the AI—and it's completely absent.

### 2. Missing Key Feature: Room Scanning
The page mentions AR visualization but not the room scanning capability that captures dimensions, existing furniture, and spatial context. This is a major functional feature that enables everything else.

### 3. No Style Discovery Narrative
The current copy doesn't explain how Patina learns user preferences. The "invisible behavioral learning" and "style that emerges, not interrogates" are powerful differentiators that aren't communicated.

### 4. Generic Feature Descriptions
Current feature copy could describe any furniture app:
- "See how furniture looks in your space" — Every AR furniture app says this
- "Explore craftspeople behind each piece" — Standard storytelling claim
- "Create collections" — Basic wishlist functionality
- "Work with designers" — Generic consultation promise

### 5. Missing "Low Friction, High Focus" Value Proposition
The page doesn't communicate that Patina shows you "10 pieces that belong, not 10,000 to sort." The focused recommendation approach is a key differentiator.

### 6. No Trust Indicators
- No mention of designer-taught intelligence
- No accuracy claims (75% → 90%+ over time)
- No privacy assurances
- No quality curation standards

### 7. Weak Headline
"Furniture shopping, reimagined" is generic and overused. It doesn't convey what's actually different about Patina.

### 8. Missing Emotional Hook
The current copy leads with features rather than the problem being solved or the transformation being offered.

## Recommended Page Structure

### Section 1: Hero (Above the Fold)

**Current:**
```
Eyebrow: PATINA APP
Headline: Furniture shopping, reimagined
Subheadline: See how pieces look in your space with AR...
```

**Recommended:**
```
Eyebrow: POWERED BY THE AESTHETE ENGINE™

Headline: Every room tells a story.
          Let's discover yours.

Subheadline: Scan your space. Uncover your style. Find furniture 
             that fits—not just the room, but the life you're building.

Secondary line: Designer-taught AI delivers focused recommendations,
                not endless scrolling.

Primary CTA: Download for iOS
Secondary: See How It Works (anchor to explainer section)
```

**Visual:** Replace generic placeholder with:
- Option A: Animated mockup showing room scan → style question → recommendation
- Option B: Split screen showing "Other apps: 10,000 results" vs "Patina: 10 that belong"
- Option C: Phone showing AR placement with designer insight callout

**Rationale:**
- Leads with emotional resonance ("story") not feature list
- Introduces The Aesthete Engine immediately
- "Designer-taught AI" is a differentiator no competitor can claim
- "Focused recommendations, not endless scrolling" directly addresses user pain

│                                                             │
│  Patina is different. Professional interior designers       │
│  actively teach our AI what works. The Aesthete Engine™     │
│  learns your style through invisible signals—then           │
│  surfaces only the furniture that truly fits.               │
│                                                             │

```

**Visual:** Side-by-side comparison
- Left: Cluttered grid of 50+ products labeled "The old way"
- Right: Curated selection of 6-8 products labeled "The Patina way"

**Rationale:**
- Articulates the problem users already feel
- Introduces The Aesthete Engine as the solution
- "Designer-taught AI" planted early, reinforced throughout

│  │ Forget lengthy questionnaires. Style questions      │   │

```

**Rationale:**
- Journey narrative vs. disconnected feature cards
- Each step mentions what The Aesthete Engine does
- Concrete examples ("marble needs coasters") make abstract AI tangible
- Time-of-day lighting is a unique feature worth highlighting

**Visual options:**
- Animated diagram showing: Designer teaching → Engine learning → User benefiting
- Before/after: Generic recommendation vs. Aesthete Engine recommendation with insight

**Rationale:**
- Dedicated real estate for the primary differentiator
- Three pillars make the system tangible
- Concrete examples ("this fabric pills with cats") demystify AI claims
- Accuracy metrics (75% → 90%) build credibility

### Section 5: Designer Connection (Revised)

**Current:** Generic "Work with expert designers directly through the app"

**Recommended:**

```

**Rationale:**
- Positions the data as valuable asset, not just convenient feature
- "Depth most consultations take weeks to achieve" quantifies value
- Bullet list makes the handoff tangible

### Section 6: Trust Indicators (NEW)

**Add social proof and trust section**

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Rationale:**
- Addresses unspoken concerns (AI accuracy, quality, privacy)
- Reinforces The Aesthete Engine differentiator
- Privacy increasingly important for AR/scanning apps

## Appendix: Full Revised Copy

### Hero Section
```
Eyebrow: POWERED BY THE AESTHETE ENGINE™

H1: Every room tells a story.
    Let's discover yours.

H2: Scan your space. Uncover your style. Find furniture 
    that fits—not just the room, but the life you're building.

H3: Designer-taught AI delivers focused recommendations, 
    not endless scrolling.

CTA Primary: Download for iOS
CTA Secondary: See How It Works
Note: Android coming soon
```

### Problem/Solution Section
```
Eyebrow: WHY PATINA

H1: Other apps show you what's popular.
    Patina shows you what's right.

Body: You've scrolled through thousands of options. Measured twice. 
Second-guessed every decision. And still, something doesn't feel right.

That's because algorithms show you what others bought—not what 
belongs in your home.

Patina is different. Professional interior designers actively teach 
our AI what works. The Aesthete Engine™ learns your style through 
invisible signals—then surfaces only the furniture that truly fits.
```

### Step 1: Walk Your Room Together
```
H2: Walk Your Room Together

Body: Point your phone at any corner and begin. Soft guidance appears 
where you need it—conversational, never technical. "Let's start with 
this wall." "Beautiful—one more corner."

While you walk, Patina captures dimensions, light, existing furniture, 
and architectural features. No tape measures. No graph paper. No guesswork.
```

### Step 2: Style That Emerges Naturally
```
H2: Style That Emerges Naturally

Body: Forget lengthy questionnaires. Style questions appear naturally 
during scanning—moments where material samples float in space and 
you tap what draws your eye.

But here's what makes us different: The Aesthete Engine also notices 
what you don't realize you're telling us. Quick taps reveal confidence. 
Slow swipes show thoughtfulness. Your actions speak louder than 
survey answers.
```

### Step 3: Designer-Taught Recommendations
```
H2: Designer-Taught Recommendations

Body: Recommendations appear like a design board being assembled—
each piece carrying its story and a professional insight you won't 
find anywhere else:

• "Perfect for pet-free homes"
• "Works best with 9'+ ceilings"  
• "Marble needs coasters—always"

Real designers teach our AI. You benefit.
```

### Step 4: Live With It First
```
H2: Live With It First

Body: Place furniture in your actual room. Walk around it. Watch 
morning light catch the grain. Slide through sunset to see leather 
warm in the afternoon glow.

Know a piece works before it arrives—not because we told you the 
dimensions, but because you've already lived with it.
```

### The Aesthete Engine Section
```
Eyebrow: THE AESTHETE ENGINE™

H1: The intelligence behind the intuition.

H2: Professional designers actively teach our AI—so recommendations 
feel curated by someone who actually knows you.

Column 1 - Designer-Taught Intelligence:
Real interior designers encode what no algorithm could discover:
"This fabric pills with cats"
"Perfect for entertainers who hate maintenance"

Column 2 - Invisible Learning:
Your actions reveal authentic preferences—tap speed, zoom behavior, 
time spent viewing. We notice what you don't realize you're telling us.

Column 3 - A Profile That Evolves:
Start at 75% accuracy. Reach 90%+ over time. The longer you use it, 
the better it knows you.
```

### Designer Handoff Section
```
Eyebrow: DESIGNER HANDOFF

H1: When you're ready for more, so is your profile.

Body: Some projects need more than an app. When you're ready, your 
room scan, style profile, and saved pieces transfer seamlessly to 
professional interior designers.

No starting over. No re-explaining. Your designer receives the depth 
most consultations take weeks to achieve—before the first conversation.

What transfers:
✓ Complete room dimensions and 3D model
✓ Your full style profile with confidence scores
✓ Behavioral signals revealing hidden preferences
✓ Saved pieces showing your direction

CTA: Learn About Design Services
```

### Trust Section
```
Eyebrow: WHY TRUST PATINA

Column 1 - Designer-Taught:
Every piece carries professional expertise. Real designers teach our AI.

Column 2 - Quality Curated:
Every item meets standards for material integrity and longevity. 
Built to last decades.

Column 3 - Privacy First:
Your room stays yours. Scan data processed locally. No third-party sharing.
```

### Final CTA Section
```
H1: Ready to discover what belongs?

H2: The best interiors aren't decorated—they're cultivated over time, 
with pieces that grow more beautiful with age.

H3: Start your journey in under 10 minutes.

CTA: Download on the App Store
Secondary: Or browse our collection on the web.
