## Executive Summary

Patina eliminates the friction between "I need furniture" and "this piece belongs in my home." Powered by The Aesthete Engine™—our proprietary intelligence system where professional interior designers actively teach the AI—Patina delivers recommendations that feel personally curated because they literally are.

**The Core Problem We Solve:**
Traditional furniture shopping forces users to mentally translate 2D images into 3D reality, guess at dimensions, and wade through thousands of irrelevant options. Algorithm-driven recommendations show you what's popular or what's been purchased together—not what's actually right for you and your space.

**Our Solution:**
Patina inverts this process. We start with your actual room and your authentic preferences, then surface only the furniture that truly fits—dimensionally, stylistically, and philosophically. The Aesthete Engine learns your design language, not just your vocabulary, becoming more fluent with every interaction.

**The Differentiator:**
Every recommendation in Patina carries the accumulated wisdom of professional interior designers who've spent years understanding why certain pieces work for certain people. They teach our system nuances no algorithm could discover: "This sofa shows pet hair." "That marble stains with red wine." "Perfect for someone who entertains but hates high-maintenance."

### The Aesthete Engine Section

**Headline:** The intelligence behind the intuition.

**Subheadline:** Professional designers actively teach our AI—so recommendations feel curated by someone who actually knows you.

#### How It Works

**1. Designer-Taught Intelligence**

Interior designers spend their careers learning the thousand tiny decisions that make a space feel right. The Aesthete Engine captures this expertise:

- "This fabric pills with cats"
- "Works best with 9' ceilings"  
- "Perfect for someone who values statement pieces over understated"
- "Marble needs coasters—always"

Every piece in our catalog carries professional annotations you won't find anywhere else.

**2. Invisible Learning**

While you browse, The Aesthete Engine notices what you don't even realize you're telling us:

- Quick taps reveal confident preferences
- Slow swipes show thoughtful consideration
- Zoom behavior exposes texture interest
- Time spent signals genuine attraction
- How fast you reject shows how strongly you dislike

Your actions speak louder than survey answers ever could.

**3. A Profile That Evolves**

Your style isn't static. Neither is The Aesthete Engine's understanding of it:

- First visit: Five natural questions establish the foundation
- Continued use: Behavioral signals refine the picture
- Designer consultation: Professional validation deepens accuracy
- Over time: Predictions improve from 75% to 90%+ accuracy

The longer you use Patina, the better it knows you.

### Value Proposition Blocks

#### Block 1: The Problem

**Headline:** Furniture shopping is broken.

You've scrolled through thousands of sofas. You've measured your room three times. You've second-guessed every decision. And still, something doesn't feel right.

Here's the truth: other apps show you what's available. They show you what's trending. They show you what others bought.

Patina shows you what's *right for you*.

#### Block 2: The Solution

**Headline:** Your room, understood. Your style, learned.

In the time it takes to walk your living room, Patina captures everything—dimensions, light, existing pieces, the subtle architecture that makes your space yours.

But here's what makes us different: while you're walking, The Aesthete Engine is learning. Not just your room's measurements, but your authentic preferences. It notices what you linger on. What you zoom into. How quickly you swipe past what doesn't resonate.

By the time your scan is complete, we understand not just your space—but you.

#### Block 3: The Difference

**Headline:** Recommendations that feel like recognition.

Other apps ask what you want. Patina helps you discover what you didn't know to ask for.

That's because our recommendations aren't generated by purchase patterns or trending data. They're informed by professional interior designers who've spent years understanding why certain pieces work for certain people—and who actively teach The Aesthete Engine what no algorithm could figure out on its own.

### Feature Highlights

#### Feature 1: Walk Your Room Together

**The Experience:**
Point your phone at any corner and begin. Soft guidance appears where you need it—never technical, always conversational. "Let's start with this wall." "Beautiful—one more corner."

**The Technology:**
Advanced LiDAR scanning captures room geometry with sub-centimeter accuracy while identifying existing furniture, windows, architectural features, and natural light patterns.

**The Aesthete Engine Advantage:**
As you scan, style questions emerge naturally—not as interruptions, but as moments of pause. The system captures not just your explicit answers but your implicit signals: decision speed reveals confidence, zoom behavior shows texture interest, tap patterns indicate certainty.

---

#### Feature 2: Style That Emerges, Not Interrogates

**The Experience:**
Midway through your scan, the room gently dims. Four material samples float in space—raw wood, soft linen, aged metal, natural stone. You tap what draws your eye. The scan continues.

**What You See:**
A simple, intuitive question that takes three seconds to answer.

**What The Aesthete Engine Captures:**
- Warmth preference (color temperature analysis)
- Complexity tolerance (visual density)
- Formality level (arrangement and materials)
- Era preference (contemporary vs traditional)
- Tactile inclination (natural vs manufactured)
- Maintenance willingness (indicated by material choice)

One tap. Seven data points. Zero friction.

---

#### Feature 3: Designer-Taught Recommendations

**The Experience:**
Select a recommendation. See its story: "Hand-turned in Ohio since 1904." But also see what only a designer would tell you: "Works beautifully in rooms with 9'+ ceilings. Navy option shows pet hair—consider gray for dog owners."

**The Intelligence Layer:**
Professional interior designers actively teach The Aesthete Engine. They analyze every piece and encode their expertise:

- **The "Who"**: Perfect for someone who loves luxury materials, has no pets, values statement pieces
- **The "Watch Out"**: Marble stains easily; needs coasters always
- **The "Goes With"**: Pairs beautifully with warm wood tones and brass accents
- **The Context**: Looks smaller in photos than reality; measure twice

This isn't algorithm-generated content. It's professional knowledge, made scalable.

---

#### Feature 4: Furniture That Fits Before You Buy

**The Experience:**
Select a recommendation. Watch it fade into your actual room. Walk around it. See how morning light catches the grain. Slide through sunset to watch leather warm in the afternoon glow.

**The Technology:**
True-scale AR placement with physics-based positioning, collision detection, and time-of-day lighting simulation.

**The Aesthete Engine Advantage:**
The system learns from your placement behavior too:
- Tried three positions? You value arrangement flexibility.
- Kept checking angles? Multiple viewing perspectives matter to you.
- Adjusted distance from wall? You prefer floating layouts.

Every interaction teaches. Every recommendation improves.

---

#### Feature 5: From Inspiration to Professional Guidance

**The Experience:**
Some projects need more than an app. When you're ready, your room scan, style profile, and saved pieces transfer seamlessly to professional interior designers who already understand your vision.

**The Aesthete Engine Handoff:**
Your designer receives:
- Complete room dimensions and 3D model
- Your full style profile with confidence scores
- Behavioral signals that reveal hidden preferences
- Saved pieces that show your direction
- The system's assessment of what you're really looking for

No starting over. No re-explaining. Your designer conversation begins where your discovery left off—with depth most consultations take weeks to achieve.
