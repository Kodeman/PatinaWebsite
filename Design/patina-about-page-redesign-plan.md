# Patina "Our Story" Page Redesign Plan

## Executive Summary

**Current State Analysis**: The existing About page at patina.cloud/about has solid structural bones but lacks the emotional depth, visual richness, and authentic storytelling that should define Patina. The page currently features placeholder imagery, fictional team members, and a generic startup timeline that doesn't communicate the real founding story or the "material feel" central to the brand.

**Vision**: Transform the About page into an immersive storytelling experience that *feels* like walking through a design studio—layered, tactile, and warm. The page should tell Kody and Leah's authentic origin story while embodying the brand principle of "Tactile Over Technical."

## Current Page Audit

### What's Working
- Clean typography hierarchy (Playfair Display + body font)
- Brand color palette is present (Off-White backgrounds, Clay Beige accents)
- Logical section flow (Mission → Values → Journey → Team → CTA)
- Timeline concept for company history
- Value cards communicate core beliefs

### Critical Issues

| Issue | Impact | Priority |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Placeholder images everywhere** | Page feels incomplete, unprofessional | 🔴 Critical |
| **Fictional team members** | Undermines authenticity—the core brand value | 🔴 Critical |
| **Generic timeline narrative** | Doesn't tell the real story | 🔴 Critical |
| **No visual textures/materials** | Contradicts "material feel" brand promise | 🟡 High |
| **Text-heavy sections** | Missing visual storytelling | 🟡 High |
| **No Midwest roots visible** | Core brand differentiator is invisible | 🟡 High |
| **No connection to Middlewest Studio** | Missing authentic backstory | 🟠 Medium |

## Design Direction: "The Workshop Wall"

### Conceptual Framework
Imagine walking into a master craftsperson's workshop. On one wall, there's a layered collage of meaning—sketches pinned over photographs, material swatches tucked into frames, handwritten notes, worn tools displayed with pride. That's the feeling this page should evoke.

### Aesthetic Principles

1. **Layered Depth**: Elements should overlap, creating visual depth like fabric swatches stacked on a design table
2. **Material Presence**: Every section should feature tactile visual elements—wood grain, linen texture, leather patina
3. **Handcrafted Warmth**: Organic shapes, hand-drawn elements, warm photography with morning light
4. **Story Over Sell**: This is narrative-first, not conversion-first

### Visual Motifs
- **Wood Grain Textures**: Subtle backgrounds evoking craftsmanship
- **Fabric Swatches**: Section dividers that look like material samples
- **Aged Paper**: Quote blocks and pullout elements
- **Workshop Photography**: Real tools, hands at work, studio environments
- **The Strata Mark**: Used as a visual leitmotif throughout

## Page Architecture (Redesigned)

### Section 1: Hero — "Where Two Paths Converged"
**Current**: Generic tagline + mission statement
**Proposed**: Cinematic opening with parallax depth

**Visual Elements**:
- Full-bleed background image with Ken Burns slow zoom

- Floating dust motes animation (like sunlight through a window)
- Strata Mark animates in—lines draw sequentially
- Scroll indicator with gentle pulse animation

**Narrative Blocks** (Progressive Reveal on Scroll):

**Block A: The Designer's Dilemma**
> *"They have incredible taste," Leah would say. "They know exactly what they don't want. But the moment I show them a piece, they can't see it. Not really. Not in their space."*

Visual: Image of Leah's material library or design presentation

**Block B: The Technologist's Itch**  
> *Kody had spent years watching how technology could either enhance human experience or bulldoze it. When AR started becoming viable, he felt something shift. But every app he downloaded missed something essential. They felt like technology demos—cold grids and clinical interfaces.*

Visual: Early AR prototype screenshot or technical diagram

**Block C: The Aha Moment**
> *"What if the technology came after the design thinking?"*

Visual: Whiteboard sketch or diagram of the realization

**Block D: Building Together**
> *They made rules: No sterile SKU grids. Stories over specifications. The technology should feel like a friend, not a robot.*

Visual: Rule cards designed as pinned notes

**Proposed**: Dedicated moment for the "Patina" etymology

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Animation Strategy

**Page Load Sequence**:
1. Hero background fades in (1.2s)
2. Strata Mark draws (0.8s, staggered lines)
3. Headline fades up (0.6s)
4. Subheadline fades up (0.4s delay)
5. Scroll indicator pulses (continuous)

**Scroll-Triggered Animations**:
- Sections fade in with 50px upward movement
- Value cards stagger in (0.1s delay each)
- Timeline entries alternate slide direction
- Quote blocks have subtle scale-up effect

**Hover States**:
- Cards lift with enhanced shadow
- Buttons have subtle color shift
- Images have gentle zoom (1.02 scale)

### Responsive Considerations

**Desktop (1200px+)**:
- Full visual experience with parallax
- Side-by-side layouts
- Large hero typography

**Tablet (768px-1199px)**:
- Stacked founder cards
- Single-column timeline
- Reduced parallax effects

**Mobile (< 768px)**:
- Full-width images
- Simplified animations
- Touch-friendly card interactions
- Collapsed timeline (vertical)

### Performance Optimization

- Lazy load images below fold
- Use WebP format with JPEG fallback
- Inline critical CSS for hero section
- Defer non-essential animations
- Compress textures to reasonable file sizes

---

## Content Requirements

### Copy Updates Needed

1. **Hero Subheadline**: New copy incorporating "husband and wife" origin
2. **Origin Story Sections**: Condensed versions of the full narrative
3. **Founder Bios**: Real descriptions for Kody and Leah
4. **Timeline Entries**: Personal milestone copy
5. **Value Card Updates**: Add two new values with descriptions
6. **CTA Copy**: Warmer, more personal language

### SEO Considerations

- Page title: "Our Story | Patina — Where Time Adds Value"
- Meta description: "Meet Kody and Leah Kochaver, the husband and wife team behind Patina. Born from real interior design work in Madison, Wisconsin."
- H1: "Where Time Adds Value"
- Alt text for all images describing context

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current Baseline | Target |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| Time on Page | Unknown | +40% |
| Scroll Depth | Unknown | 80% reach CTA |
| CTA Click Rate | Unknown | 15% of visitors |
| Bounce Rate | Unknown | -20% |
| Qualitative | Feels generic | "This tells a real story" |

---

## Summary

This redesign transforms the About page from a generic startup story into an authentic, emotionally resonant narrative that embodies Patina's core brand principles. By incorporating:

1. **Kody and Leah's real origin story**
2. **Material textures and tactile visual language**
3. **Midwest roots and Middlewest Studio connection**
4. **Rich photography replacing all placeholders**
5. **Thoughtful animations that feel organic, not technical**

...the page will become a powerful brand-building asset that differentiates Patina in a crowded market and builds genuine connection with visitors.

The page should feel like you've stepped into Kody and Leah's workshop—surrounded by meaning, warmth, and the quiet confidence of people who make beautiful things together.
